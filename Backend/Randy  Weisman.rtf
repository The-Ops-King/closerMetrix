What would make this call a huge win for both of you? What would you like to get out of this call?\

\f0\b Randy Weisman
\f1\b0 \
I guess I'd want to know, well, the whole reason why I'm exploring this is because of the short-term tax loophole that kind of cropped up that now allows the 100% bonus depreciation in year one.\
So that's why I started exploring this. And we've kind of gone back and forth as to whether or not, you know, certainly we'd love to have a profitable, but we, you know, we're also thinking, oh, well, what if we, you know, bought a place?\
Peace. Peace. Peace. We it as a short term rental, and if it's not making money, we could potentially just move into it, or move my mother into it, you know, and kind of get out of that game.\
But I, the idea would be to actually make money with it. But we've, I've been kind of back and, been back and forth over, you know, how, how this would all run.\
We both have a bit of free time, you know, we both still work, but we do have a decent amount of free time to actively manage the business.\
I'm semi-tired, so I work part-time.\

Nice. Okay, got it. So the way that I want to, yeah, the way that I want to make sure this works, right, we'll discuss a little bit about all of that.\
What I want to do is I want to dive in to really where it is, and what it is you guys are really looking for.\
It sounds like there's a couple. So hopefully we'll figure out a little bit more of a concrete plan. My goal is to build you a roadmap for that plan.\

\f1\b0 \
Okay. So what would be a great outcome for you in 3, 6, 12 months from now? What is the outcome?\
Is the outcome pay zero in taxes? Is the outcome a specific number in cash flow every month?\

\f0\b Randy Weisman
\f1\b0 \
What's the goal? Or the tax thing? Well, I think the tax thing, was looking for the benefit for this year.\
If we bought a place, did the cost segregation study, and did the bonus depreciation this year, got some tax benefit this year.\
And then for next year, you know, I would hope that it would at least break even. You know, I'd be fine if the thing were making $500 a month or whatever.\
at $500 a As long as, you know, the hassle factor is not too terrible on it, you know, certainly I'd love to make more on it, but just as long as the hassle factor isn't terrible on it, I don't know if I would turn it over to an active management company at some point, but that might, if it's, if it's profitable enough, then that's an option.\

\f0\b J. Tyler Ray (Tyler Ray)
\f1\b0 \
Yeah, it really just depends. Most of our students, it takes them about 30 minutes a week per property. Active management, it's fine, but it's a little bit of a pain because they take a big spread, usually between 15 to 25% of net, or excuse me, of gross, so you're left with, I mean, pennies usually.\
So we usually instruct people to do it, do it themselves, and you get that extra bonus depreciation as well.\
Even in year two, there's tax benefits to that if you spend at least 100 hours a year. So massive, massive, massive tax benefits, even in year two, three, five, 10.\
Right. Yeah, I get so excited. So if I start bouncing off the walls a little bit, you guys, you got to forgive me because it is really so exciting to me.\
So I am curious, what's the number that we're looking at to depreciate in tax? How much are you usually spending in tax every year?\

Now, that can come with four or five properties if you buy them right. That's what they're looking to do.\

Well, I guess if it's four or five properties, I guess they're, you know, if they're pulling in 5k per property, it seems like a lot.\
I see. see. And in the Valley here, I don't know that they're clearing a lot of 5k in June, July and August.\
Correct, yeah. get a 10k in, you know, through April, but I don't know, it's a bit more...\

\f0\b J. Tyler Ray (Tyler Ray)
\f1\b0 \
you're totally right. You're totally right. That's the part of it, and I'm actually going to get to that, so you're ahead of me and I love it.\
Part of that issue is where to buy the property, right? Like you said, nobody wants... Right now, it's 107.\
I'm looking at the temperature. Nobody wants to be here. I don't want to be here, right? So these months in Phoenix, yeah, it's rough.\
But like you said, in the winter, pulling in sometimes, like in Scottsdale, there's some really gorgeous properties up there.\
They're pulling in 10, sometimes 15k a month in cash flow. So it evens out. The other part of that is, a lot of the time, people will choose a market.\
think 95% of the They'll choose a market that's not their own, just because that's where the cash flow is.\
The average price for a starter home in here in Phoenix, in the Phoenix Valley, what is it, like 400,000?\
Whereas somewhere nicer, I guess nicer temperature-wise, is going to be a little bit less, or over here is going to be a little bit more, whatever it is.\
It's just making sure, you're a numbers guy, we want to make sure that the numbers line up and actually work.\
Most people, it's kind of a hope and a prayer, and they say, hey, I've got a rental out in Globe, let's make that an Airbnb, see how that works.\
Think that's going to work, a rental out in Globe? There'd no chance, right? So having that system of step-by-step, what are the legalities of it, where do I find a property, what do I do, that's a huge, huge wall, bottleneck that people run into.\
The second thing is, they try to do... too many things at once. A lack of focus, a lack of that, just gonna do one thing and then move on to the next.\
We try to juggle, right? Glenda, since you're essentially retired, you're working because you want to, you can spend a little bit of time in that focus that's required.\
While you're learning in the first 60 to 90 days, it's gonna take about five hours a week. Is that something that you can commit?\
Yeah.\

Cool. So those are the main things that I wanted to mention that most people have an issue with. Now, most people are looking to get to that 20K a month.\
Again, that's with three, four, five, sometimes six or seven properties. If your goal is to just break even, guys, that is so dead simple.\
Honestly, in this next second year, if you're just breaking even, even that 30 minutes a month is going to, or 30 minutes a week, excuse me, is going to become a little bit of a drag.\
Because it's like, why am I doing this if I'm not gaining anything from it? So I want you gaining at least a little something.\
What a lot of our clients do is they'll pick a spot, of course, with good cash flow, but that they want a vacation to themselves.\

It's pretty fun. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to do one up in, hopefully, Pinetop. I've got some family up there, so that might be fun.\

I have a better understanding of what the tax law actually is, because we have some differing, I guess, ideas on it.\
Do you want to explain what you clarified? Well, here's the thing. So my initial understanding was, okay, say you did a cost segregation study, and it says, okay, well, a third of your $500,000 house is eligible for your bonus depreciation, say the insides of the house.\
So a third of it, say you go with a third, so $130,000 is eligible for writing off. So it's not like you do dollar for dollar, $130,000 off your taxes.\
It's what is your adjusted gross income? What are you paying in terms of, you know, say your adjusted gross income is $400,000.\
...$130,000. So it would essentially knock off $130,000. So it's not like dollar for dollar 130 is coming off your taxes.\
would just sort of ... So it's really a third of the $130,000 that you're actually coming off your taxes.\
So that would be ... rendition think I understand where you're coming from. ... Yeah. So that would be $45,000 technically is actually what's going in your pocket.\

It depends. Because of what's going on with the big, beautiful bill, it's being called, hard for me to say, you can actually take that full bonus depreciation in year one.\
Most of our clients are high W-2 earners and they're offsetting anywhere. depends from, like you said, $30,000, $45,000. I've seen up to like $70,000 as well.\

Right. So if I have a hundred grand of 1099 income and I have a hundred NGT depreciation, the two offset, I was only gonna pay $40,000 in taxes on 100 grand anyway.\

Yeah, we do actually on staff. Yeah. There's people that we, we hook up. So we basically, we help you from start to finish, right?\
From no experience to super host making two to five, 10 or two to $7,000 cash flow per property, depending, right?\
Depending on risk tolerance, depending on location, depending on you guys, we're going to sit down with you and build a plan specifically for you of like, hey, what's important?\
Do we want to have a home in Mesa, Scottsdale area so we can have it? Stop Airbnb-ing if we want later on?\
it. in I Where Okay, we might have to be okay with a little bit less cash flow. But if we're open to more cash flow, cool, we'll move it to somewhere else.\
We'll sit down with you and we'll create that custom plan for you so that it's, yeah, we get the tax benefit.\
Yeah, we get the actual property, the appreciation, the cash flow, et cetera. Fair? Cool. So what we can do now, let's go over a little bit about what we do, how we get you there, and then we'll talk about that for a minute.\

Okay. We help people, like I said, go from zero to super host. Our top tier of coaching, now this is people who are already got 15, 20 Airbnbs, they're crushing it, they're doing everything.\
They pay Michael up to like $50,000 to do that. That's not going to be what you need. I'm not going to ask you for 50K.\
The program, the coaching that we do is 12K for six months. Okay. That includes everything. As far There's the education, the learning, what does the tax look like, how to do it.\
The first part of that is actually the training, the learning of what that looks like. Remember when we were talking about being in Globe, just throwing darts at the map saying what happens?\
I don't want that to be you guys. I want you all to know exactly where to purchase that property, what that's going to do before you even purchase it.\

Try to find your own things so that you can learn the process. Then we'll help you with it. We'll take a look at that property that you found, two or three of them, and we'll say, okay, let's take a look at this.\
This might not be a great property because of X and Y reasons. This one's a really great property. Have you thought about this?\

question. Yeah. So we have the course material as well, because if you want to go and rewatch it a couple of times, it's there.\
Rather than somebody teaching the same thing 300 times, let's just give you the course material. We've also got about 20 hours a week of group coaching calls.\
You do not have to go to all of them. Some people are like, so you don't have to go to all of them, just whatever applies to you.\
So if you want to go to the tax one that we have, think once a week, you go to that one, you learn about it, you ask questions, right?\

One of Michael's properties is cash flowing in 15K. Genuinely don't know how he did that one, but just one of them is flowing that.\
So a lot of his students come back and they do that there and they come back and they teach.\
But we don't let them teach until they've reached a certain threshold of actually success so they actually know what they're doing.\
And then we also bring in experts as well. Like I said, if you have a contractor, an amenities person, or if you have an interior designer, we have called Summer Bright.\

You that's going to be rough to find a good property and to fix it up a little bit, to put some amenities, furniture.\
That's going to be a little bit rough. 100K that you're looking to put in, that's a little bit better.\
I think we could probably work with that. But there's always trade offs, right? Do we trade a little bit of cash flow for being local?\

I wish I could give you a specific number. Sometimes you just don't. Sometimes you find a good house with a good deal and you just run with it.\
Other times, a lot of people like to like the fix and flip a little bit. So they'll buy a little bit more of a distressed house, paint it up, do it up exactly how they want it.\
They like to do that. And then you get a little bit of that sweat equity as well. But again, it's just so customized to you, right?\
Nobody's going to be the same. So you might find a house that has just been flipped. It's gorgeous, ready to go, turnkey, essentially.\
Put some furniture in there and you spend, I don't five, $10,000 maybe on furniture and you're good to go.\

But then you get all that bonus appreciation at the end of the year, right? You're paying lower in property taxes because you bought it for a lower amount.\
And then you put some work into it, but I don't know, another $50,000 into just renovating it. Well, now it's worth $100,000 more, and you only put $50,000 into it.\
So there's just, again, there's just trade-offs. It's like, do I want the equity? Do I want the cash flow right away?\
Do I just want to get into it for as little as possible? That's, that's all things that we got to figure out.\

So that's that's kind of my point is like you can absolutely go and do that yourself. Hundred percent. I mean, that's how Michael did it.\
But it cost my He lot of time and money trying to figure it out himself. He had the YouTube, he had the books, he didn't have a mentor.\
And what I find is, people can do that. People do often do that. They say, I'm gonna go do it myself.\
And what they find is, holy cow, this is a lot harder than I thought it was, and then they come back to us anyway, $50,000, $20,000 poorer.\
Yeah. Not to say that you can't do it on your own. It's just kind of, it's like you're paying for speed, right?\
You buy a fast car, you're paying for speed. You're paying for luxury. You're paying for like making things happen.\
You can go out and buy a beater for sure. That's not what you want a lot of the time.\

A lot of our coaches come in and they're often high-income W-2 earners. They're doctors, lawyers. They're doing well, but they're in a time prison or a trading time for money kind of prison.\
Well, when that is removed from them, they fall in love with it. And they say, holy cow, this is the best thing I've ever done.\
I don't need any more money. I'm making 20, 30k a month. Let's help some people out, right? You guys are doing the same thing for your kids.\
